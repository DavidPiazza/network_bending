## Usage

### Basic Network Bending

1. Load a model checkpoint using the standard ComfyUI loader nodes
2. Add a "Network Bending" node to your workflow
3. Connect the MODEL output to the Network Bending input
4. Configure parameters:
   - **Operation**: Select the type of bending operation
   - **Intensity**: Control the strength (0.0 = no effect, 1.0 = maximum)
   - **Target Layers**: Specify which layers to modify (e.g., "conv", "attention", or "all")
   - **Seed**: Set for reproducible results (-1 for random)

### Layer Targeting

You can target specific layers using patterns:
- `all` - Modify all layers
- `conv` - Target convolutional layers
- `attention` - Target attention layers
- `linear` - Target linear/dense layers
- `norm` - Target normalization layers
- `embedding` - Target embedding layers
- Combine patterns with commas: `conv,attention`

### Model Mixing

1. Load two model checkpoints
2. Add a "Model Mixer" node
3. Connect both models to the mixer inputs
4. Set the mix mode and ratio
5. Connect the output to your generation pipeline

### Latent Format Conversion

1. When you encounter dimension mismatch errors between audio and image models
2. Add a "Latent Format Converter" node between the latent source and destination
3. Set conversion mode (or use auto_detect)
4. Choose appropriate reshape method (fold works well for audio‚Üíimage)
5. Adjust target dimensions if converting to image format
6. Set target_channels to match your model (4 for SD/SDXL, 64 for StableAudio)
7. Use "project" channel mode for best results when converting channels

### VAE Network Bending

1. Load a VAE or get one from a checkpoint loader
2. Add a "VAE Network Bending" node
3. Connect the VAE to the input
4. Choose operation and target component (encoder/decoder/both)
5. Set intensity and preserve_mean option
6. Use the bent VAE for encoding/decoding

### VAE Latent Manipulation

1. Encode an image to latent space using VAE
2. Add "VAE Latent Bending" or "VAE Channel Manipulator" nodes
3. Connect latents through the manipulation nodes
4. Experiment with different operations and intensities
5. Decode back to image to see the effects

## Tips

1. **Start with low intensity values** (0.01-0.1) and increase gradually
2. **Target specific layers** for more controlled effects
3. **Use seeds** for reproducible results
4. **Combine operations** by chaining multiple bending nodes
5. **Save interesting results** as new model checkpoints

## Troubleshooting

- **No effect visible**: Increase intensity or check target_layers pattern
- **Model breaks completely**: Reduce intensity or target fewer layers
- **Out of memory**: Operations clone the model, ensure sufficient VRAM
